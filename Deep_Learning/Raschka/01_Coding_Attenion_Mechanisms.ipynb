    "An input sequence is denoted as x, consisting of n elements represented as x^1 to x^n. This sequence represents text that has already been transformed into token embeddings. E.g. below our input text is \"Your journey starts with one step\". Each element of the sequence, such as x^1, corresponds to a d-dimensional embedding vector representing a single token, lke \"Your\" (in the example below, d = 3).\n",

    "In self-attention, the goal is to calculate context vectors z^i for each element x^i in the input sequence. A <i>context vector</i> can be interpreted as an enriched embedding vector. Each context vector z^i contains information about x^i and all other input elements, x^1 to x^n. This is essential in an LLM, which needs to understand the relationship and relevance of words in a sentence to each other. In practice, trainable weights help an LLM learn these context vectors to help it generate the next token."

We do this by computing the dot product between the query (as an example, x^2) and every other input token. <u>A dot product is the multiplication of two vectors element-wise and then summing the products</u>. It is a measure of similarity because it quantifies how closely two vectors are aligned: a higher dot product indicates a higher degree of similarity between the vectors. For self-attention, the dot product determines the extent to which each element in a sequence focuses on (attends to) any other element. The higher the dot product, the higher the similarity and attention score between two elements."
