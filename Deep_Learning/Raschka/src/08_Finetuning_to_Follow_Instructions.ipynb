    "Pretraining an LLM involves a training procedure where it learns to generate one word at a time. The resulting pretrained LLM is capable of text completion, meaning it can finish sentences or write text paragraphs given a fragment of input. However, they struggle with specific instructions, such as \"fix the grammar in this text\". Here, we will focus on improving the LLM's ability to follow such instructions and generate a desired response. \n",

    "In contrast to the classification fine-tuned model, this type of model can typically undertake a broader range of tasks. The former is highly specialised and easier to develop, compared to the latter which is a generalist model that works well across various tasks. "
